			<h1>The Woodpecker Song 4a</h1>
				<p>by Marion Hutton</p>
				<p>He's up each morning bright and early
	To wake up all the neighborhood
	To bring to every boy and girlie
	His happy serenade on wood.</p>
				<p>Hear him pickin' out a melody
	Peck, peck, peckin' at the same old tree.
	He's as happy as a bumble bee
				All day long.</p>
				<p>Come on BABE and try that rhythm
	Just let your heart beat with him
	And when you hear that tick-a-tick-tick, tick-a-tick-tick
	Tick-a-tick-tick, sing right along. </p>
